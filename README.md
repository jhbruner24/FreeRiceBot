"Earn instant rice with this free bot"

This bot was designed for educational purposes only and is not meant to take advantage of FreeRice.com.

This Bot works by importing "webdriver" from "selenium" and then using the webdriver to selectively read and click on html elements hosted at FreeRice.com.

If you would like the bot to also log you in prior to solving the multiplication problems, it is essential that you insert your login credentials in the requisite spaces.
